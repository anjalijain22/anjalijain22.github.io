              If you are reading this, that can only mean one thing: You think you don’t have what it takes.
              You are probably done with life and tired of doing the same thing over and over again. Maybe you feel as though
              nothing matters right now. Your general attitude is, “Kya hi farak padta hai. Chalne do jo jaise chal raha hai!”
              Or, perhaps you have a large task in front of you, and you are in no mood to work on it. Whatever the case may be,
              I’m so glad that you opened this letter. It’s going to kick your butt in the best way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lets get a few thing straight. You are capable. You are smart. You are intelligent. When you don’t know the answer to
              a question — and it is impossible to have every single one — you figure it out. You find smart ways to get your work done.
              And you do whatever it takes to achieve your end goal. All this takes heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember the time you arranged buses for migrant workers during the lockdown? You had no business in helping those people
              but you still did it. And it may not seem like a big deal to you but I am telling you it is a fucking big deal. You
              helped so many people reach home safely. This shows just how sensitive you are. You are not like the rest of world, who
              would sit in front of the TV and go tch tch. You see something thats wrong and you do something about it. Because that is YOU!
              You are capable to do everything and anything once you set your mind to it. Your dedication and commitment is unmatched
              like the time when you worked day night on the AYF workshops. You are a team player, you are ready to give your everything
              like the time when you were ready to play cricket even with a fucked up leg. NOBODY I repeat NOBODY DOES THAT.
            </p>
            <p>
              You want to know something else? You have failed before. We all have. But look where you are.
              You are right here — and that means something. You were meant to be here, experiencing this right now.
              You may ask yourself, “Why me?” or, “Why do I have to do this now?” I wish I had the answers,
              but I don’t think anyone does. The simple fact is, the universe has called upon you for this task or this burden,
              and it is your job to bear it the best you can.
            </p>
            <p>
              And you are the best, by the way? Incredible. You have overcome so much already and have gotten so far,
              and you hardly give yourself enough credit — are you rolling your eyes yet? Well, stop it.
            </p>
            <p>
            You’re magnificent, unique, special, talented, calculated, analytical, and the best person to tackle this right now
            — without a doubt.
            </p>
            I love you, and YOU CAN do it.
            <p>
              Lots of love,<br>
              Anji
            </p>
