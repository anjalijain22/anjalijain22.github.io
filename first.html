            <p>
              After almost four years, I am pleased to inform you that your constant perseverance or should
              I say *pestering* for "Open When Letters" has finally paid off. And here I present to you "Open When Letters". I like to call this
              the <b>Covid Version</b>. Just so you know making this was tough okay so don't expect any gift for atleast another five years!
              Hahah Just joking or am I? We'll only find out :p
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this letter, I want you to know just how much I love you! I mean now you have to believe when I say that I love you
              coz come on I made you a fucking website. You are truly a keeper and I seriously cannot imagine my life without you anymore.
              You are a perfect mix of smart, crazy, sensible and senseless. You are ready to fight for others and that is so rare. Nobody
              even does that anymore. You know so much about so many things that you can strike a conversation with almost everybody
              in this entire world. And almost everyone you meet falls in love with you like literally!! You are so motivating and so caring
              and the best part about you is how quickly you evolve and adapt yourself. To me, you are perfect and I am so thankful to
              past Anjali that she didn't chicken out from being your sister.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that I am going to Canada, I might not always be one call away (because of the time zone ofcourse). So this is my attempt
              to try to be as close to you as possible so that you never feel alone. I am only one letter away! I hope you enjoy each and
              every bit of this present. I will keep adding more letters with time and if I don't then you can try the pestering again! :P
              The only literally only <b>RULE</B> that you have to follow is - </p>
                <blockquote><p>Open the letter when you actually feel that particular emotion or when the given situation
                applies to you!</p></blockquote>
              <p>
                Its not hard to follow it okay! Don't ruin the entire jist of this website by reading all the letters in one go! So baby, Here
                is wishing you one hell of a year filled with more self-growth, self-love, self-acceptance and success in all fields of your life!
                I am always here with you no matter what and I love you more with each passing day! Happy Birthday Big Sister!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lots of hugs and kisses,<br>
              Anji
            </p>
